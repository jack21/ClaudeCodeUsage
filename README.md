> **What this is, in one sentence:** a VS Code status-bar monitor that
> reads your local Claude Code conversation logs and shows
> **token-derived** usage and cost estimates — plus an optional AI advisor
> that suggests how to use Claude Code more economically.
>
> **What this is _not_:** a billing tool. All amounts are estimates;
> refer to your official Anthropic account for actual charges.

> **一句话简介**:一个 VS Code 状态栏小工具,读取本地 Claude Code
> 对话日志,按 token × 公开单价估算用量与成本;并提供可选的 AI
> 建议功能,帮你改进使用习惯。
>
> **它不是什么**:账单工具。显示金额均为估算值,实际费用请以官方账单为准。

## Screenshots

### Status bar

![Status bar](images/v2-status-bar-en.png)

*Today's cost · current-session cost · 5-hour and weekly quota utilisation.*

Hover the quota indicator for a breakdown:

![Quota tooltip](images/v2-quota-en.png)

*Real `/usage` data — utilisation percent, reset countdown, and the
weekly reset weekday and time.*

### Dashboard

![Dashboard — summary and charts](images/v2-dashboard-en.png)

*Click the status bar to open the full dashboard. Stacked token-composition
chart, hourly breakdown, cache hit rate, cost composition by token type,
plus per-model and per-day tables below.*

### Content tab — where your tokens actually go

![Content tab](images/v2-content-en.png)

*Estimated breakdown of which content consumes tokens — your prompts vs.
tool results (by tool) vs. assistant output / thinking. This is the lever
for optimising your usage. Scoped to the last 30 days.*

### AI advice (opt-in)

![AI advice](images/v2-advice-en.png)

*Optional AI advisor sends your aggregates + a sample of your prompts
to an OpenAI-compatible API (DeepSeek V4 Pro by default) and suggests
concrete rewrites. **Bring your own key** — or click `Preview demo`
on the warning prompt to see a static example first.*

## What's new in 2.0

- **Real 5-hour and weekly quota** in the status bar — reads Claude Code's
  existing OAuth session at `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, zero config.
  Adapted from upstream [PR #9](https://github.com/jack21/ClaudeCodeUsage/pull/9)
  by [@Dobidop](https://github.com/Dobidop).
- **Four new tabs**: Sessions, Projects, Content, Branches — all sortable.
- **Token-composition stacked chart** with Y-axis and reference lines.
- **AI advice command** (DeepSeek V4 Pro default, `reasoning_effort=max`)
  with a demo-mode fallback when no API key is configured.
- **Multi-vendor pricing**: Opus 4.x, Sonnet 4.x, Haiku 4.5 (verified
  against Anthropic's public pricing); reference rates for proxied setups
  (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen) with family-aware fallback.
  `Refresh Token Pricing` pulls live LiteLLM data as runtime overrides.
- **Custom timezone** for date display (`claudeCodeUsage.timezone`).
- **Light-theme tab readability** fixed.
- **Locale-aware numbers and dates** throughout (German `.`, English `,`).
- **Real-time status bar** via `fs.watch` (1.5 s debounce) + idle-aware
  refresh + non-blocking loader (yields every 25 files).

## Install

### VS Code Marketplace

Search for **`Claude Code Usage`** in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`),
or:

```
ext install GrowthJack.claude-code-usage
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / Antigravity (Open VSX)

Same extension is published at the Open VSX Registry:
[GrowthJack.claude-code-usage](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items/?itemName=GrowthJack.claude-code-usage).

### From a `.vsix` file

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** → pick the
downloaded `.vsix`.

---

## Configuration

Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`) and search for **`Claude Code Usage`**. All
settings are optional; defaults preserve upstream behaviour where
reasonable.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refreshInterval` | `60` | Refresh interval in seconds (min 30). |
| `dataDirectory` | `""` | Custom Claude data dir; empty = auto-detect. |
| `language` | `"auto"` | UI language: `auto` / `en` / `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` / `ja` / `ko`. |
| `decimalPlaces` | `2` | Decimal places in cost display (0–4). |
| `compactNumbers` | `false` | Show `1.2M` / `345K` instead of full numbers. |
| `timezone` | `""` | IANA timezone for date display (e.g. `Asia/Hong_Kong`). |
| `usageLimitTracking` | `true` | Show real 5h / weekly quota in the status bar. |
| `enableContentAnalysis` | `true` | Run the Content tab token analysis. |
| `projectGroupingMode` | `"git"` | Projects tab grouping: `git` / `folder` / `flat`. |
| `advice.apiKey` | `""` | API key for the AI advice feature (OpenAI-compatible). |
| `advice.apiUrl` | `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions` | Chat-completions endpoint. |
| `advice.model` | `"deepseek-v4-pro"` | Model name. |
| `advice.reasoningEffort` | `"max"` | Reasoning effort (DeepSeek V4: `high` / `max`). |

## How costs are calculated

The status-bar cost is **`Σ (tokens × per-million rate)`** across input,
output, cache-write and cache-read, summed by model.

- **Per-million rates** come from the bundled pricing table, which is
  verified against the public Anthropic pricing page and supplemented
  with reference rates for non-Anthropic models that may appear in
  proxied setups.
- **`Refresh Model Pricing`** (command + button in the dashboard) pulls
  live prices from [LiteLLM's public dataset](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
  as runtime overrides.
- **Unknown model snapshots** are priced against the current tier of
  their detected family (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku / GPT / Gemini /
  DeepSeek / Kimi / GLM / Qwen) instead of falling back blindly.

What the status bar does **not** know:
- Your actual Anthropic invoice (discounts, free credits, plan caps).
- Whether your proxy provider charges different rates.
- Anything not recorded in your local `.jsonl` log files.

The **5h / weekly quota indicator** is different — it queries Claude
Code's real `/usage` endpoint via the OAuth session and shows the actual
percentage Anthropic is tracking for your account. That number is
authoritative.

---

## Privacy

- All token / cost / session analysis runs **locally** by reading your
  `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` files.
- The quota indicator calls **`api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`** using
  Claude Code's existing OAuth token. No additional credentials are sent.
- The **AI advice command** is the only feature that calls an external
  service — and only when *you* trigger it. It sends an aggregate summary
  of your usage plus a sample of your recent user prompts to whatever
  endpoint you configured in `advice.apiUrl`. **Bring your own key**;
  nothing is shipped with the extension. If no key is configured, the
  command opens a hand-written demo instead of calling any API.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No Claude Code Data"**
- Make sure Claude Code is installed and you have used it at least once.
- Check the `dataDirectory` setting; auto-detection looks at
  `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.config/claude/projects`.

**Quota row shows `5h:--% wk:--%`**
- The OAuth token at `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is missing or expired.
  Log in to Claude Code once; the extension reads its credential file
  read-only and refreshes the bearer if needed.

**`Get AI Usage Advice` returns 404**
- DeepSeek's current endpoint does **not** use a `/v1` prefix. Use
  `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`. The extension auto-strips
  `/v1` if present.

**`Get AI Usage Advice` shows demo instead of real advice**
- That means no API key is configured under `claudeCodeUsage.advice.apiKey`.
  The demo file is filename-marked `…-DEMO-…` with a prominent banner.
  Add a key in Settings and re-run the command.

**Sluggish refresh on large histories**
- 2.0 yields to the event loop every 25 files; idle ticks skip recompute.
  If you still hit issues, raise `refreshInterval` or set
  `enableContentAnalysis` to `false`.

**Previous months' history is missing**
- The extension reads Claude Code's conversation transcripts, and Claude Code
  automatically deletes transcripts older than its `cleanupPeriodDays` setting
  (default **30 days**). Once the logs are gone, that usage can no longer be
  shown. To keep more history, raise `cleanupPeriodDays` in your Claude Code
  settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):
  ```json
  { "cleanupPeriodDays": 365 }
  ```
  This affects data retained from now on; already-deleted logs cannot be
  recovered.
